# Blog Lisp Source

This repository contains the source code for the blog series [Writing a
Lisp](http://bernsteinbear.com/blog/lisp/). It is a submodule in the [main
repository](https://github.com/tekknolagi/tekknolagi.github.com), allowing it
to be checked out and updated independently of all of the rest of the blog.

## Structure

The files are separated as the blog posts are. Each is prefixed with the same
number as the blog post. `00_fundamentals.ml` for "Part 0: Fundamentals",
`01_booleans.ml` for "Part 1: Booleans", etc.
